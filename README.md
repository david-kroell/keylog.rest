REST-API Keylogger Webapplication in Node.js

Documentation can be found at <https://david-kroell.github.io/keylog.rest/> and in this file.

# Installation
## Running locally
### Dependencies
There is only one dependency, as npm gets installed with Node.js. But here is the 'complete' list:
* Node.js
* npm

Make sure you also install the database and the Node.js driver you want to use.
Available database systems:
* PostgresSQL
* MySQL
* MSSQL
* SQLite

[Click here if you want to learn something about the necessary database drivers](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/installation/getting-started.html#installation)

### Prepare the installation

* Get the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/david-kroell/keylog.rest
```
* Install npm packages
```bash
cd keylog.rest && npm install
```
* Configure your installation

Copy ```config.example.js``` to ```config.js``` and move on with the [configuration section](#configuration).

* Run the application
```bash
npm start
```
Or make use of something like ```pm2```.

## Deployment using Docker
### Single Container
Do NOT use the following command to run the container, because there is some more to do...

```bash
docker run -d --name keylogger -p 3000:3000 davidkroell/keylog.rest
```

First of all head onto [configuration](#configuration) and get your config file ready. 
You are also able to use your custom payloads.

```bash
docker run -d --name keylogger -p 3000:3000 \
    -v /path/to/payloads:/usr/src/app:ro \
    -v /path/to/config.js:/usr/src/app/config.js:ro \
    davidkroell/keylog.rest
```
I assume you understand the command above, as if you are currently in the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) section.

### Using microservices
Actually, there is no more documentation than the following docker-compose example file.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web-api:
    image: davidkroell/keylog.rest
    container_name: keylog.rest-api
    restart: always
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
      # use this if you are behind a proxy, this is the header, which the proxy sets
      PROXY_HEADER_REAL_IP_KEY: x-real-ip # for jwilder/nginx-proxy
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    networks:
      - mysql
    volumes:
      - "./config.example.docker.js:/usr/src/app/config.js:ro" # customize
      # - "/path/to/payloads:/usr/src/app:ro"
    depends_on:
      - "mysql"
  mysql:
    image: mysql
    container_name: keylog.rest-db
    restart: always
    environment: ### customize
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "secret"
      MYSQL_DATABASE: "keylogger"
      MYSQL_USER: "keylog_user"
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: "secret"

networks:
  mysql:
```

# Configuratoin
You can specify custom configuration using the ```config.example.js``` file. But make sure to copy it or rename it to ```config.js``` as it wonÂ´t work if you do not.

```js
// config.js (from config.example.js)
module.exports = {
    db: {
        database: "",
        username: "",
        password: "",
        dialect: "sqlite",
        sqliteFile: path.join(__dirname, "db.sqlite")
    },
    api: {
        keys: [
            'secret',
            ''
        ]
    }
}
```

The ```db``` section holds information about the database connection.

The ```api``` section holds information about the api and the keys for accessing it.
